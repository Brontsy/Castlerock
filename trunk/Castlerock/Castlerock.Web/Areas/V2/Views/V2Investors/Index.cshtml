                Castlerock's simple investment structures, with government-backed tenants, are designed to have less risk than more complicated property funds. This makes them attractive to long-term investors who are seeking a stable income flow and the potential for capital growth.
            </p> 

            <h3>Choice of funds</h3> 
            <p> 
                We continue to develop new portfolios of government-leased buildings, which can offer investors some flexibility in the method and timing of distribution payments. This enables investors to choose a fund they believe best suits their income needs.
