<p>
    The Auslink Property Trust is an unlisted property trust designed to provide investors with stable long-term income from a 
    portfolio of government-leased assets. 
</p>

<p>
    The Trust primarily develops and holds Centrelink Customer Service Centres. We believe that the Commonwealth Government has a long-term 
    requirement for these centres, and if they are purpose-built and well managed, the government will continue to occupy them for the long term. 
</p>

<p>
    Established in December 2008, the Trust currently owns four Centrelink Customer Service Centres in Boronia VIC, Carnarvon WA,
    Port Pirie SA and Footscray VIC, and is developing a fifth Centrelink in South Brisbane QLD.
